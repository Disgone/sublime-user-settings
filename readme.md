# Sublime Settings

I tend to change environments quite often, so this is a location I can store my current settings for Sublime Text 3.  

The user settings can be easily located by opening Sublime, then choosing `Preferences -> Browse Packages`. User settings are stored in the `User` folder.

## Requirements

There are some great packages floating around for Sublime, and combined with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) it's pretty quick and easy to tailor the environment for your needs.

Most of these settings should work out of the box, though there are a couple for themes/fonts which will need to be installed for all of these settings to display as intended.

* [Boxy Theme](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Boxy%20Theme)
* [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

## Other Packages
